# pygame-paint
The first pygame project that I have completely finished.
It taught me a lot of things including :
 - manipulating arrays
 - creating interfaces with pygame (buttons and sliders)
 - writing an iterative flood fill algorithm
 - saving/loading images using tkinter
 - managing a one-week project
